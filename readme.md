## Repository Overview

The "clone-pages" repository contains multiple clones of popular web pages, including (but not limited to):

- Google Sign Page
- Facebook (coming soon)
- Twitter (coming soon)
- Apple (coming soon)
- Microsoft (coming soon)
- Instagram (coming soon)

Each clone is created using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for learning and potential use on devices with limited resources like the ESP32.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Purpose

This project serves multiple purposes:

1. To create lightweight, functional web interfaces for devices with limited resources (e.g., ESP32)
2. To provide a learning resource for other developers interested in web cloning techniques

## Implementation Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No external libraries or frameworks are used to keep the codebase minimal and efficient.
- **Responsive Design**: Each page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Error Validation**: Basic client-side validation is implemented where applicable.
- **Size Optimization**: Each clone is kept under 20,000 characters to meet ESP32 limitations.
